# School_District_Analysis
Module4 - Pandas DF
**Overview of the school district analysis:**
We have the Schools data and the Students data in files, we merged the data from both these files on 'school_name' to perform analysis on the data.
The data contains math and reading scores for students, along with their gender, name, grade, school name, etc.

**Results:**
How is the district summary affected?
_The district summary in the module vs the challenge is only affected due to the mapping and formatting._

How is the school summary affected?
_The school summary was unaffected for all schools, except for the Thomas High School, where % overall passing 
dropped from 90.94% to 65.07%_

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
_The replacing of the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance negatively. As stated above,
The scores for % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and the % Overall Passing dropped._

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
_- Math and reading scores by grade - 9th grade, just for Thomas High school shows as NaN; no other schools and their grades were affted
- Scores by school spending - No changes observed
- Scores by school size - No changes observed
- Scores by school type - No changes observed_

**Summary:**
_Using pandas, numpy, and multiple modules from these packages, we were able to calculate and analyze data for Schools and Students._
